# üìä CodeAlpha_Sales_Prediction

This project was developed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. It demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting product sales based on advertising spend using regression models in Python.

---

## üîç Project Objective

Predict future sales based on advertising spend across three media channels:
- **TV**
- **Radio**
- **Newspaper**

We aim to:
- Understand how each channel influences sales.
- Train machine learning models to predict sales.
- Provide actionable insights for marketing strategy.

---

## üßæ Dataset

The dataset used is `Advertising.csv`, which contains 200 observations and 4 columns:
- `TV`: Advertising spend on TV (in $ thousands)
- `Radio`: Advertising spend on Radio (in $ thousands)
- `Newspaper`: Advertising spend on Newspaper (in $ thousands)
- `Sales`: Product sales (in $ millions)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Data Exploration
- Used Seaborn to create a pairplot and explore relationships between features.
- Summary statistics and distribution analysis.

### 2. Data Preparation
- Features selected: `TV`, `Radio`, `Newspaper`
- Target variable: `Sales`
- Train-test split: 80% training / 20% testing

### 3. Model Training
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination)

### 5. Business Insights
- Used Linear Regression coefficients to interpret impact of each advertising channel.
- Provided actionable recommendations based on results.

## ‚úÖ Results

| Model              | MAE   | RMSE  | R¬≤ Score |
|-------------------|-------|-------|----------|
| Linear Regression | 1.46  | 1.78  | 0.899    |
| Random Forest     | 0.62  | 0.77  | 0.981    |

- **Random Forest performed better overall.**
- **TV and Radio spend have the most significant positive impact on sales.**
- **Newspaper ads have little to no effect.**

---

## üìå Insights

- Increasing **TV** and **Radio** advertising budgets leads to higher predicted sales.
- **Newspaper** spending shows minimal return and may not be cost-effective.
- Focus on channels with proven ROI using data-driven decisions.
